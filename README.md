# ICC Profile processing for TYPO3 File Abstraction Layer

## Abstract

This extension pre-processes images using the File Abstraction Layer to
convert color schemes. For instance, if print images (e.g. TIFF) are used,
this extension allows to define ICC color profiles to be used to transform
e.g. the CMYK space to some RGB space.
